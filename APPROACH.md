- **Contour Analysis**: Polygon approximation for geometric shape classification
- **Pattern Recognition**: Area-based filtering and aspect ratio analysis
- **Confidence Scoring**: Area-normalized confidence calculation

### 3. Detection Features

The system identifies multiple types of archaeological indicators:

- **Geometric Structures**: Rectangular, circular, and triangular patterns
- **Vegetation Anomalies**: Areas with unusual vegetation patterns
- **Soil Disturbances**: Color variations indicating subsurface structures
- **Linear Features**: Pathways, roads, and boundary markers

### 4. Performance Optimizations

- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Dynamic threshold adjustment based on image characteristics
- **Multi-scale Analysis**: Processing at multiple resolution levels
- **Noise Reduction**: Morphological operations for cleaner feature extraction
- **Computational Efficiency**: Optimized OpenCV operations for real-time processing

### 5. Output Format

Results are exported in both JSON and CSV formats containing:
- Geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude)
- Confidence scores (0.0 - 1.0)
- Site type classification
- Detailed feature descriptions
- Evidence type categorization

## Scientific Basis

Our approach is based on established archaeological remote sensing techniques:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Archaeological sites often display geometric regularity distinct from natural formations
2. **Vegetation Stress**: Subsurface structures can affect vegetation growth patterns
3. **Soil Chemistry**: Archaeological deposits can alter soil color and composition
4. **Multi-spectral Analysis**: Different spectral bands reveal various archaeological indicators

## Validation and Testing

The system has been tested with:
- Synthetic archaeological features
- Diverse geometric patterns
- Various vegetation conditions
- Multiple coordinate systems

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include:
- Deep learning CNN integration
