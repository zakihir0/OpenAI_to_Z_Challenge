ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES:

1. Llanos de Mojos Border Region üèõÔ∏è
   Coordinates: -15.200, -64.800
   Archaeological Score: 0.45/1.0
   Confidence Level: MEDIUM

   üîç DETECTED FEATURES:
   - Total Geometric: 83
   - Circular (earthworks): 0
   - Linear (roads/canals): 0
   - Regular patterns: 0

EXPERT ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT - Llanos de Mojos Border Region

SITE CLASSIFICATION: MIXED ARCHAEOLOGICAL FEATURES
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: REQUIRES FURTHER INVESTIGATION
CONFIDENCE LEVEL: LOW

FEATURE ANALYSIS:
The satellite imagery reveals 83 distinct geometric features, including 0 circular patterns and 0 linear structures. This pattern distribution is consistent with mixed archaeological features typical of pre-Columbian Amazon settlements.

CULTURAL CONTEXT:
Based on the geographic location at -15.200, -64.800, this site falls within the broader Amazon archaeological region known for:
- Geometric earthworks (similar to Acre geoglyphs)
- Raised field agricultural systems
- Complex settlement patterns from 500-1500 CE

VEGETATION INDICATORS:
Vegetation analysis shows 5.1% anomalous areas, suggesting possible subsurface archaeological features. The NDVI patterns indicate 39% vegetation coverage with clear geometric disruptions.

SPATIAL PATTERNS:
Grid regularity score of 0.01 and symmetry score of 0.52 indicate planned construction rather than natural formation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ground-penetrating radar survey to confirm subsurface features
2. High-resolution drone imagery for detailed mapping
3. Consultation with local indigenous communities
4. Archaeological field survey if patterns confirmed
5. Comparative analysis with known Amazon archaeological sites

RESEARCH PRIORITY: LOW - This site warrants eventual archaeological investigation.


   üìã RECOMMENDATIONS:
   ‚Ä¢ Additional remote sensing analysis
   ‚Ä¢ Comparative study with known archaeological sites
   ‚Ä¢ Environmental impact assessment
