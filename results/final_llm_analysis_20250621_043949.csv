The slope panel reveals subtle concentric elevation changes supporting this interpretation. True-color shows no visible clearing, indicating ancient features obscured by regrowth.",Geoglyphs (ditched enclosures)

These circular features align with known geoglyph formations in the region. The slope panel reveals subtle topographic depressions corresponding to these circles, suggesting artificial earthworks. True-color shows no visible surface disruption, indicating ancient and reforested structures.",Pre-colonial geoglyphs (ditched enclosures)

These circular features are approximately 200m in diameter with geometric regularity inconsistent with natural formations. The slope panel reveals subtle topographic depressions corresponding to these circles, suggesting possible ancient ditch-and-embankment structures. The true-color RGB shows no visible surface features, indicating deep forest cover obscuring ground visibility.",Geoglyphs (ditched enclosures)

The slope panel reveals subtle concentric circular depressions approximately 100m in diameter, consistent with known Amazonian earthworks. True-color RGB shows no visible surface features, indicating heavy vegetation cover masking the structures.",Geoglyphs (ditched enclosures)

These circular features are approximately 100m in diameter and exhibit geometric regularity inconsistent with natural formations. The slope panel reveals subtle topographic depressions corresponding to these circles, suggesting possible ancient ditches or earthworks. The true-color RGB shows no visible surface structures, indicating deep forest cover over potential archaeological features.",Geoglyphs or ceremonial earthworks
