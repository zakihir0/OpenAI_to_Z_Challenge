{"contains_anthropogenic_features": true, "confidence_score": 0.85, "rationale": "The NDVI panel shows distinct circular patterns with lower vegetation density (darker green) surrounded by higher density (brighter green), suggesting possible geoglyph features. The slope panel reveals subtle concentric circular depressions approximately 100m in diameter, consistent with known Amazonian earthworks. True-color RGB shows no visible surface features, indicating heavy vegetation cover masking the structures.", "feature_type_guess": "Geoglyphs (ditched enclosures)"}
