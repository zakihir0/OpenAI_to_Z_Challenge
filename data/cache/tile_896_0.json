{"contains_anthropogenic_features": true, "confidence_score": 0.85, "rationale": "The NDVI panel shows distinct circular patterns of lower vegetation density (darker green) within the dense rainforest canopy. These circular features are approximately 200m in diameter with geometric regularity inconsistent with natural formations. The slope panel reveals subtle topographic depressions corresponding to these circles, suggesting possible ancient ditch-and-embankment structures. The true-color RGB shows no visible surface features, indicating deep forest cover obscuring ground visibility.", "feature_type_guess": "Geoglyphs (ditched enclosures)"}
