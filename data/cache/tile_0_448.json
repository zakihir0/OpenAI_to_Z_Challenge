{"contains_anthropogenic_features": true, "confidence_score": 0.85, "rationale": "The NDVI panel shows distinct circular patterns with lower vegetation density (darker green) contrasting with surrounding forest. These circular features are approximately 100m in diameter and exhibit geometric regularity inconsistent with natural formations. The slope panel reveals subtle topographic depressions corresponding to these circles, suggesting possible ancient ditches or earthworks. The true-color RGB shows no visible surface structures, indicating deep forest cover over potential archaeological features.", "feature_type_guess": "Geoglyphs or ceremonial earthworks"}
